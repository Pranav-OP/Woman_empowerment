        <h1>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="box">
            <h2>Why Especially Women Empowerment Became Necessary?</h2>
            <p>Empowerment of women is not only necessary; it has become an imperative now. Over the last three decades, various women’s organizations, N.G.Os, and liberal Governments are actively working towards empowerment of women. The status of women is overall deplorable, oppressive and discriminatory through the length and breadth of Indian states irrespective of the party and gender of political leader in power. Some illustrations of discriminations and nature of violence against women may not be out of place here to comprehend their status in the social, economic and political spheres in different countries including India. Only five per cent members of the United Nations have ratified the Convention of the International Labor Organization (1981 & 1982) protecting women with family responsibilities against unfair termination of employment. In the United States of America about 77 percent of poverty is borne by single, divorced, or widowed women. Though the Communist ideology constitutionally favors sexual equality, it is found that in Soviet Union nearly 88 percent women are ditch diggers while less than 1 percent of the Soviet Academy of Science is women. In Indonesia the discrimination is more pathetic. A 15 year old boy is considered to be the legal head of the family in his father’s absence even if his mother is a lawyer or a teacher in high school (Eschel, 1989, p. ix). Though women comprise 50 percent of the world’s total population, they hold less than 12 percent of the seats in the national legislatures. Out of 177 countries of the world only in 14 countries women hold more than thirty per cent seats in their national parliaments. This includes European and American countries where, too, women fail to enjoy equal political power and equality. As it is found in the Napoleonic Civil Code which states that, “those persons without rights at law are minors, married women, criminals and the mentally deficient” (Eschel, 1989, p. 17). If we look at the status of women in India, we could see that the socio-economic and political status of women is similarly horrible. As per the 2011 census of India the literacy rate of women is only 65.46 percent whereas this rate for men is 82.14 percent. So there is clear gap of 16.68 percent between men and women, and about 35 percent women in India are illiterate. In rural areas women’s education rate is even worse. The census data indicate that the literacy rate of rural Indian women is only 58.75 percent in comparison to men’s 78.57 percent. The sex ratio is also deplorable. “One of the striking features of 2011 Census is that the sex ratio has drastically gone down from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011. This shows that Indian people have more preference over boy child than the female child. Female feticide is increasing in an alarming rate in India and this is more so among the states having high literacy” (The Yojana, August 2012, p.71). The Sixth All India Educational Survey of NCERT (1995) found that women formed 23% of primary teachers in rural areas as compared to 60% in urban areas; at the upper primary, the corresponding figures are 25% and 59%. There is also discrimination in recruitment of women as primary teachers. There are lack of women’s vocational training institutions in India. “Out of 2240 Industrial Training Institutions (ITIs), Industrial Training Centers (ITCs), there were 154 women ITIs/ ITCs and 129 women wings in General ITIs to specifically cater to vocational training needs of women”(The Yojana, August 2012, p.71.). Women’s position in parliament is also discouraging. “The current 15 th Lok Sabha has the highest number of Women MPs. Women constitute 11 per cent of the 15 th Lok Sabha” (The Yojana, August 2013, p. 18). Women’s estimated earned income (PPP US$) in 2007 was only $1,304 but Men’s estimated earned income was $4,102. On the contrary, this rate for the United States’ men is $34,996 and women’s earned income is $5,536 (The World Bank, 2009). Rate of women’s death during child birth is also depressible. “Maternal Mortality Rate per 1000 live births in India is 212 (2009)” (The Kurukshetra, August 2012, p. 16). Child marriage is another problem in India. “However, 36.8 percent of girls marry before attaining 18 years of age and the median age of the girls at the first marriage is 17.2 years,” though legal age of marriage for a girl is 18 years. As a result of early marriage, about 16 percent girls within the age group of 15-19 years had begun childbearing. Anemia, especially in adolescent girls, is an equally challenging problem. 36 per cent of women within the age group of 15-49 years had a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5 kg/m2 and about 47 per cent of the girls in the age group 15-19 years had BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2 indicating chronic nutritional deficiency (The Yojana, November 2012, p. 43). Anemia results in poor health and poor physical growth; it also reduces school performance and diminishes concentration. “Iron Deficiency is the most widespread nutritional deficiency disorder in the country today. Nearly 58 per cent pregnant women, 50 per cent women in reproductive age, 56 per cent adolescent girls, 30 per cent adolescent boys and 70 per cent children under five years of age are anemic” (The Yojana, August 2013, volume 57, inside cover page).</p>
