                Community  engagement through  College  Student  Volunteers  is envisioned  in  115  most  backward  districts  as  part  of  the  MSK Block level initiatives.  Student volunteers will play an instrumental role    in    awareness    generation    regarding    various    important government  schemes/  programmes  as  well  as social  issue  and association  with  NSS/NCC  cadrestudents  will  also  be  an  option.The  scheme  at  the  block  level will  provide  an  opportunity  to Student  Volunteers  to  participate  in  the  development  process  by bringing  change  in  their  own  communities  and  ensuring  that women  are  not  left  behind  and  are  equal  partners  in  Indiaâ€™s progress. 
                In the first year (2017-18), Mahila Shakti Kendras(MSK)will be set up  in  50  backward districts  out  of  115 backward  districtscovering400  blocks  in  50  most  backward  districts  (maximum 8  blocks  per district) are to be covered under block level initiative.

In the third year, activities will be taken up in all 115 backward districts covering 920 blocks  (i.e.  8  blocks  per  district)  for  six  months.  At  the  end  of second    year,    the    scheme    will    be    evaluated    to    decide expansion/continuation of the scheme.
